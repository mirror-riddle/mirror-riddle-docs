## pubilc, private, protected

`public` 类、实例都可以访问

`private` 只有在包含它的类里才能访问

`protected` 在包含它的类里，以及子类里可以访问

## Parameter properties

构造器的参数，如果有`readonly`, `public`, `private`, `protected` modfier 的话，会自动变成类属性。

```typescript
class Octopus {
  readonly numberOfFlags: number = 10;
  constructor(readonly name: string) {}
}
```

## Accessors

First, accessors require you to set the compiler to output ECMAScript 5 or higher. Downleveling to ECMAScript 3 is not supported. Second, accessors with a get and no set are automatically inferred to be readonly. This is helpful when generating a .d.ts file from your code, because users of your property can see that they can’t change it.

```typescript
const fullNameMaxLength = 10;

class Employee {
  private _fullName: string;

  get fullName(): string {
    return this._fullName;
  }

  set fullName(newName: string) {
    if (newName && newName.length > fullNameMaxLength) {
      throw new Error('fullName has a max length of ' + fullNameMaxLength);
    }

    this._fullName = newName;
  }
}

let employee = new Employee();
employee.fullName = 'Bob Smith';
if (employee.fullName) {
  console.log(employee.fullName);
}
```

## 静态属性

`static`

## Abstract Classes

Abstract classes are base classes from which other classes may be derived. They may not be instantiated directly. Unlike an interface, an abstract class may contain implementation details for its members. The abstract keyword is used to define abstract classes as well as abstract methods within an abstract class.

Methods within an abstract class that are marked as abstract do not contain an implementation and must be implemented in derived classes. Abstract methods share a similar syntax to interface methods. Both define the signature of a method without including a method body. However, abstract methods must include the abstract keyword and may optionally include access modifiers.

```typescript
abstract class Department {
  constructor(public name: string) {}

  printName(): void {
    console.log('Department name: ' + this.name);
  }

  abstract printMeeting(): void; // must be implemented in derived classes
}

class AccountingDepartment extends Department {
  constructor() {
    super('Accounting and Auditing'); // constructors in derived classes must call super()
  }

  printMeeting(): void {
    console.log('The Accounting Department meets each Monday at 10am.');
  }

  generateReports(): void {
    console.log('Generating accounting reports...');
  }
}

let department: Department; // ok to create a reference to an abstract type
department = new Department(); // error: cannot create an instance of an abstract class
department = new AccountingDepartment(); // ok to create and assign a non-abstract subclass
department.printName();
department.printMeeting();
department.generateReports(); // error: method doesn't exist on declared abstract type
```

## Advanced Techniques

声明一个类时，声明了两种东西：实例的类型`SomeClass`，构造函数的类型`typeof SomeClass`
